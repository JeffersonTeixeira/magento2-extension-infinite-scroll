# Magento 2 Infinite Scroll extension by [Shopigo](https://www.shopigo.ch)

On large catalogs, pagination can make navigation between tens of pages a nightmare for customers.

The Infinite Scroll extension replaces the default paging system available in all catalog category and search results pages by an auto-load mechanism based on the AJAX functionality.

When the customer scrolls down a page, the following page is instantaneously loaded.
Thanks to this extension, customers could discover the entire catalog by just scrolling down!

This extension offers 4 scrolling modes (automatic, automatic up to X pages - then manual, automatic each X pages and manual) and a wide panel of features.
